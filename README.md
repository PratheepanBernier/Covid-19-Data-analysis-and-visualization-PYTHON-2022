# Python-Data-Analysis-Project-01-Covid-19-Data-analysis-and-visualization
In this Project , I have made analysis using Covid-19 data and visualized it .

Downloaded data from kaggle and loaded it into the google collabarotory and using python libraries like pandas and numpy 
done some analysis and made a visualisation using matplotlib and seaborn libraries for making charts like pie, bar, line, relational, scatter etc.

Thank you!
